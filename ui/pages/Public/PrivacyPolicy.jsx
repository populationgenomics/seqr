    The Broad Institute of MIT& Harvard (<b>&quot;Broad&quot;</b>) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy
    (<b>&quot;Policy&quot;</b>) provides important information about how Broad collects and uses your Personal
    Information (as defined in Section 6 below) through the seqr platform.

    <b>
      &nbsp;Please make sure you review this Policy before using the seqr platform. If you have any questions about
      this Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:seqr@populationgenomics.org.au">seqr@populationgenomics.org.au</a>.
    </b>

    <Header content="1. Who is Broad?" size="medium" />
    Broad is a non-profit research institution that is dedicated to improving human health by using genomics to advance
    our understanding of the biology and treatment of human disease, and to help lay the groundwork for a new
    generation of therapies.  For more information on the organization, please
    see <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/about-us">https://www.broadinstitute.org/about-us</a>.  We will refer
    to Broad in this Policy as <b>&quot;we,&quot;</b> <b>&quot;us&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;our.&quot;</b> <br /><br />

    This Policy applies to the seqr platform, which is a web-based application developed and hosted by Broad
    (the <b>&quot;Platform&quot;</b>). This Platform is used by both Broad employees and external collaborators across
    the world to analyze and diagnose patients with rare genetic diseases. While the Platform is owned by the
    Broad&apos;s Translational Genomics Group, the genomic and other data hosted within the Platform
    (<b>&quot;Genomic Data&quot;</b>) is owned or controlled by the data contributor who consented the sample and
    uploaded the data to the Platform. <br /><br />

    Please note that the Platform may link to other websites that are not affiliated with us
    (<b>&quot;Third-Party Sites&quot;</b>). We may offer those links as a convenience to you but we are not responsible
    for the privacy practice of those Third-Party Sites. You should make sure you review the privacy policies for those
    Third-Party Sites before providing them any of your information.

    <Header content="2. What is the purpose and scope of this Policy?" size="medium" />
    This Policy describes the Personal Information we collect from users of the Platform, the purposes for collecting
    that information, how we use that information, and with whom we share that information.  Please note that this
    Policy only applies to information that we collect about users of the Platform, and does not apply to Genomic Data
    about Research Participants that may be contributed by users to the Platform.

    <Header content="3. Does this Policy Apply to Genomic Data Uploaded to the Platform?" size="medium" />
    This Policy only applies to information that we collect about users of the Platform, and does not apply to Genomic
    Data contributed by users to the Platform. While the Platform also allows users to view and contribute Genomic Data
    for research purposes,  the relevant Genomic Data contributor is  responsible for obtaining all necessary
    permissions and consents for such data.  If you are a user of the Platform, you are required to keep the Genomic
    Data confidential and not to disclose such data to any third party, except other users of the Platform with
    permission to view it.  If you are an individual whose Genomic Data has been uploaded to the Platform
    (a <b>&quot;Research Participant&quot;</b>) and have questions about the privacy or use of your Genomic Data, please
    refer to the research consent for the study you participated in for more information, including contact information.

    <Header content="4. If I use the Platform, am I agreeing to this Policy?" size="medium" />
    Yes.  However, your use of the Platform is entirely voluntary and you have certain rights to control use of your
    information as described below.  If you decide to use the Platform, you are agreeing that we can use your
    information as described in this Policy.

    <Header content="5. How do we collect information from you?" size="medium" />
    We collect information about you in two ways.  The first is information you voluntarily provide to us when you
    choose to do any of the following, none of which is required:
    <List bulleted>
      <List.Item>
        register to use the Platform, such as when you create an account on the Platform, in which case we collect your
        name and e-mail address;
      </List.Item>
      <List.Item>

      </List.Item>
    </List>
    In all these cases, we only collect information that you have provided to us, except for information obtained
    through cookies and the tracking technologies noted below. The second way we collect information is through certain
    automated technologies that are used when you access our Platform.  An example is a &quot;cookie&quot;, which is a
    small piece of computer code that is placed on your computer or other device that can be used for various purposes,
    such as to recognize a user or to track their activities on a website.  We describe  automated technologies in more
    detail in Section 7 below.  We collect various information through these automated technologies, including your
    Device Information as described in Section 6 below; your Location Information as described in Section 6 below; and
    how you use our Site and App, such as the web pages you view, the links you click, the length of time you visit our
    Platform, and the web page or web site that led you to our Platform.


    <Header content="6. What kind of information do we collect?" size="medium" />

        Internet), a device ID (which is a number assigned to a mobile phone by the device manufacturer), or the type of
        operating system or web browser used to access the Platform.
      </List.Item>
      <List.Item>
        <b>&quot;Location Information&quot;</b> is information that can be used to identify your geographical location,
        such as where you are geographically located when you are accessing the Platform using a mobile phone.  We will
        not collect Location Information from your mobile phone using a location-based service without sending you a
        separate notice to your mobile phone and obtaining your consent.  Please note, however, that certain automated
        technologies such as cookies can identify IP addresses and other data to infer the location of a device that you
        may be using.
      </List.Item>
    </List>

    <Header content="7. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?" size="medium" />
    Yes.  We use cookies for various purposes, such as to make it easier for you to navigate our Platform, to enable a
    faster log-in process, or to allow us to track your activities on our Platform.  There are two types of cookies:
    session and persistent cookies.
    <List bulleted>
      <List.Item>
        <i>Session Cookies.</i> Session cookies exist only during a session.  They disappear from your computer or
        device when you close your browser or App or turn off your computer or device.  We use Session Cookies to allow
        our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Platform.  This allows us
        to process your communications and requests and verify your identity after you have logged in and as you move
        through our Platform, and to optimize your experience when using the Platform.
      </List.Item>
      <List.Item>
        <i>Persistent Cookies.</i> Persistent Cookies remain on your computer or device after you have closed your
        browser or turned off your computer or mobile device.  We use persistent cookies such as local storage objects,
        and other similar technologies to track activity on our Platform and to enhance the functionality of our
        Platform to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity on our Platform (see
        &quot;Tracking Technologies&quot; below).  We may also use local storage objects to collect and store
        information about your visits to our Platform, such as page visits, the duration of the visit, the specific
        link(s) that you clicked during your visit, and the address of the website from which you arrived at the
        Platform.
      </List.Item>
    </List>

    <b>Disabling Cookies.</b> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your
    browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
    prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie,
    or how to disable cookies altogether.  Visitors to our Site who disable cookies may not be able to browse certain
    areas of the Site or use the Platform.<br /><br />

    <b>Tracking Technologies.</b> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage
    of our Platform.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services.  We use these tools to help us
    improve our Platform, performance, and user experiences.  We may also use third-party tracking technologies,
    such as a web application firewall, to detect malicious code or attacks on our Platform. These entities may use
    cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your Personal Information with
    these third parties.

    <Header content="8. Do you respond to Do Not Track signals?" size="medium" />
    Do Not Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When users turn on
    DNT, their browser sends a message to websites requesting that they do not track the user. However, our Platform
    does not change its information collection in response to DNT browser settings or signals. For information about
    DNT, visit <a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.

    <Header content="11. Can other users see my Personal Information?" size="medium" />
    The Platform allows you to interact with other users.  Therefore, any information that you post to the Platform,
    including your contact information, will be visible to other users. Although we expect users to only use such
    information in connection with the Platform, we cannot assure you that such other users will not disclose or use
    your information outside of the Platform.

    <Header content="12. What rights do I have with respect to my information?" size="medium" />
    Users can update their seqr profile at any time.  All users can also contact us to request access to, a copy of,

    at <a href="mailto:seqr@populationgenomics.org.au">seqr@populationgenomics.org.au</a>. <br /><br />

    We will respond to any user request as soon as we reasonably can, and within the time and in the manner required by
    law.  We may request additional information from you to verify the request.  We may not be able to accommodate all
    requests; for example, we may be unable to accommodate a deletion request if we are required to maintain information
    under law or a legal obligation or if information is used as part of a published study.

    <Header content="13. What kind of security does seqr use to protect my information?" size="medium" />
    We use reasonable security to protect the Personal Information we collect from users, including using our good faith

    information we collect or any transmission of information over the Internet.  For this reason, you should make sure
    that you keep your profile account on the Platform confidential, including any user identification or password.  You
    should also notify us immediately if there has been any unauthorized use of your account.
